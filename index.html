        <h3>With great power comes great responsibility</h3>
        <p>Spider-Man appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe.  His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense".</p>

      <h3>About <span class="Highlight-name"> Spider </span> suit</h3>
      <p>Marvel Cinematic Universe fan art imagines what Spider-Man's next suit could look like in Spider-Man: Homecoming 3. Though always a beloved character, Spider-Man has experienced a boost in recent years thanks to Tom Holland's performance as Peter Parker. First introduced in Captain America: Civil War, Holland's Spider-Man quickly became a standout, with many praising his chemistry with the other Avengers.</p>
